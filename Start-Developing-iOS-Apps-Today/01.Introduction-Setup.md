A few Objective-C concepts
---

* Objects are building blocks for apps
* Classes are blueprints for objects
* Objects communicates through messages
  * one object **sends a message** to another object by **calling a method** on that object.
  * `[somePerson sayHello]`
* Protocols define messaging contracts
  * the same with `interface` in java

**ARC** : Automatic Reference Counting
`@autoreleasepool`: part of the memory management infrastructure


```
int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
        @autoreleasepool {
                    return UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, nil, NSStringFromClass([AppDelegate class]));
                        }
}
```

* Most of the work is done by the `UIApplicationMain` function, which is automatically called in your project’s `main.m` source file. 
* The `UIApplicationMain` function creates an application object that sets up the infrastructure for your app to work with the iOS system. 
* This includes creating a **run loop** that delivers input events to your app.

* The `@autoreleasepool` statement supports memory management for your app. 
* **Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)** makes memory management straightforward by getting the compiler to keep track of who owns an object; 
* `@autoreleasepool` is part of the memory management infrastructure.

`UIApplication` *in the UIKit framework*

`AppDelegate` **app delegate**

* The app delegate interface contains a single property: `window`. With this property the app delegate keeps track of *the window in which all of your app content is drawn*.
