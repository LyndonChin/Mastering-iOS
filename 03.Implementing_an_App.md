Incorporating the Data
---

### Designing Your Model

* How will the user use your app, and what types of data do you need to store?
* What data structures can you use?
* How will you supply data to the user interface?

### Using Design Patterns

* MVC-centric-design
* Target-Action
* Delegation

### Working with Foundation

* Most value classes create their instances by declaring both initializers and class factory methods
